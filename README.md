# Shape-Inheritance
Class project for Object-Oriented and Concurrent Programming
<br><br>
A command line driven program with a Java class inheritance hierarchy to satisfy a is-a and has-a relationship based on a “Shape” theme. 2D shapes with area and 3D shapes with volume descended from the superclass Shape. When given input from the user the program would display the area or volume of their chosen shape.
